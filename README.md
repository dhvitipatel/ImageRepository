# Art Repository
This is a simple image repository created by Dhviti Patel. 
This is a python app, implemented using sqlite3 and flask for a web interface and ability to track inventory, transcactions and information about the product. 

## Features
- Buy/Sell Art Peices along with information about how much money one spend purchasing and updating inventory. 
- Add Art Peices to the inventory.

## Structure
The code is split into three files __init__.py (application layer), server.py (logic) and model.py (data). This practices clean code and code maintainability following model view controller pattern.

## Usage
After cloning the repository, install `flask`. Run `python3 __init__.py` in your terminal, this will automatically create the database. 
Now your app will be live on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which is the general flask server.
